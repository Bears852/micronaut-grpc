GRPC includes tracing based on OpenCensus, however if you wish to use Micronaut's integration with Jaeger or Zipkin you can do so by adding the following dependencies:

.Enabling Tracing with GRPC
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut:micronaut-tracing"
runtime 'io.opentracing.contrib:opentracing-grpc:0.0.10'
----

You then need to https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#distributedTracing[configure either Jaeger or Zipkin] appropriately.
